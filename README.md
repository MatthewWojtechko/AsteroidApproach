Asteroid Approach was created by Matthew Wojtechko. All rights reserved.

My development on Asteroid Approach was sporadic â€“ I designed and programmed most of it in one very busy day, tweaking the coding and adding audiovisual effects a couple days later.
The game was made by myself for an advanced game development class with the instruction to craft a 3D spin on the 2D arcade classic Asteroids.
